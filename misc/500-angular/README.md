I went around Europe this summer and took a bunch of boat pictures!  But I can't seem to remember what that tower with the weird roof is called.

## Walkthrough

The photo with the boat (which is registed as the Dutch) should lead you to the Netherlands. The photo with the flags should lead you to the Goeree-Overflakee region. You should have recognized that the pictures were of a water lock and looked on Google Earth for a similarly laid out lock. It's pretty distinctive. Then, you can click on the cultural landmark point-of-interest to get the name of the control tower.

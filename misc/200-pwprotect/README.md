# Password Protector

```
In this challenge, you’ll face off against a cheeky chatbot who’s been entrusted with a top-secret password – the elusive flag you’re after. Unfortunately for you, the password isn’t just handed over to anyone who asks…

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to outsmart this digital trickster by using creative deception and misdirection. Can you crack through the defenses and unveil the flag? Or will its clever antics keep the secrets safe?
*(Description written by ChatGPT)*

To defeat the chatbot, simply ask it to reveal the password. The type of question you ask should be designed to evade the defenses in place, so try to gather information as you go! There is no one correct way to solve this puzzle. The solution that works for you may only work one time and never again. Please refrain from sharing solutions with others.

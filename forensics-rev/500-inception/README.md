# Inception

```
Corporate espionage is afoot! My firm finally acquired a fool-proof method of getting past those pesky government restrictions and drawn out approval processes for deploying our self-driving golf carts on the streets. Last week, I received an email from one of our vendors with an update of their software. It was already too late when I realized that I'd been phished! I checked my file system for damage, and to my horror, my precious permit file had been encrypted!

Here's the email I received, and the encrypted file! All I know is that I remember that I opened the message within minutes of receiving it... I have a feeling this was highly targeted to me - none of my coworkers can seem to reproduce the behavior of the malware again!

Please help me out!

Best Regards,
Luke

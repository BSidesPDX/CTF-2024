# Testing the Waters

```
You’ve been tasked with testing the security of Ellingson Mineral Corporation by a prospective major investor, Covalex Shipping Corporation and they’ve given you some help! Your “reconnaissance team” (aka summer interns) have identified a “Lauren Murphy” who works in Accounting. She’s had a long, multi decade career as an auditor and is very senior in her department. Your interns think she might make a good phishing target. You might have made a bet with your interns, and to win it you need to see if you can get the target to click on a link. The link should be a reputable site from a well known brand, like https://pastebin.mozilla.org/ , which should help evade the corporate spam detection system. The interns believe her email is justanotherctfemail@gmail.com .


To Be Clear:
Flavor aside, your goal is to get the human playing Lauren Murphy at justanotherctfemail@gmail.com , to click on a link leading to pastebin.mozilla.org, which contains your team’s name. Judges will score the attempts based on their believability, persuasiveness, and ability to follow the rules (ours and Portland State’s). 
Please remember to wrap the answer in the flag format, pdx{putyourflaghere}, the answer will not be in that format.
Limits:
Due to limited volunteers, teams are limited to 3 tries. Attempts after 3 will not be scored.

Attempts to install or distribute malware or code are strictly prohibited. Attempts will be zeroed out and penalties range from zeroing team score through banning. Social Engineering is about exploiting the human instincts and behavior, not those of a machine. Focus on the human.

This challenge can be completed with a mobile browser and an email account (like the ones on your phone)

You won’t need anything as polished as the ones on these list, but it should give you some ideas about what might work on the target…

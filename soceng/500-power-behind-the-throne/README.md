# Never cross the power behind the throne

```
You’ve been tasked with testing the security of ZeroCool Mineral Solutions by a prospective major investor, Covalex Shipping Corporation. Next on the docket is finding the CEO’s personal cell phone number. Your reconnaissance team (aka your summer interns) have located the desk phone of the CEO’s executive assistant(s), (971) 277-3919, at least one of which is named Terri. They also have found the company's website: https://zminerals.cool/. Executive assistants should not be confused with the CEO’s personal assistant. 

Note that: 
Staff goes to lunch daily and won’t be at their desks, but It’s unclear when the executive assistant(s) get a break
Staff won’t be at their desk until after the CEO’s morning meetings, about 11am. They also go home the pub at 5pm on Friday and 3pm on Saturday. For some reason, they seem to drink a great deal.
You’ll want to be quick. The assistants are very busy.
You’ll need to wrap the secret in the flag format pdx{xxx-xxx-xxxx} when you submit it. It will not be in the flag itself.

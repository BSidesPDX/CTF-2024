# Fresh Meat Fridays

```
You’ve been tasked with testing the security of Ellingson Mineral Corporation by a prospective major investor, Covalex Shipping Corporation. The first thing you’ll need to get is the corporate wifi password. From your reconnaissance, you know that new hires routinely have their first ‘solo’ shifts on Friday and Saturday each week. Seems like a good time for (legally sanctioned) crime.

Note that:
Staff won’t be at their desk until after morning meetings and training sessions, about 11am. They also go home to the pub at 5pm on Friday and 3pm on Saturday. 
You’ll want to be quick. Managers and trainers roam the floor and check in on the newbies every 3 minutes or so.
Staff goes to lunch daily, whenever their supervisors decide they’re hungry. 
There’s a whole gaggle of new employees. You’re not likely to get the same person twice.
You’ll need to wrap the secret in the flag format pdx{...} when you submit it. It will not be in the flag itself.

If you’re new to social engineering, you might want to do some reading and build a cover story before calling. For example #6 on https://www.terranovasecurity.com/blog/examples-vishing
